# How To Use the RPG Tilesets

Hi! If you're reading this, you probably want to download the tileset that I have made, great!

Here's how you use them:

1. Install Inkscape if you haven't already (can be found [here](https://inkscape.org/en/)).
2. Open the .svg file in Inkscape
3. Copy and paste the tiles that you need from the top few rows to make your map
   * You can rotate tiles by clicking on them twice (rotate arrows should appear)
   * You can rotate tiles in fixed angles by holding Ctrl
   * You can enable corner snapping to make alignment easier (should be on by default)
4. Once you're done you can export the vector to an image and/or print it out.

If you have any questions, feel free to contact me.
